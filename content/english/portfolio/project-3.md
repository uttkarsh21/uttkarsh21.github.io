GeoExplorer is an educational game has been developed for undergraduate classroom settings for the instruction of Geotechnical Engineering (i.e., a subdiscipline of Civil Engineering). The vision behind this game is to provide experience for undergraduate civil engineering students with various field testing techniques for which students traditionally get little to no hands-on exposure. The current version of the game focuses on Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) and gives students an opportunity to experience and learn the important geotechnical engineering task of identifying soil types across different locations via CPT.
