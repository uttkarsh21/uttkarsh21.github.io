In Debris, players are tasked with assigning contractors to collect debris around a borough in New York after it was hit with a natural disaster. The players need to do this while considering the three objectives of time spent, money earned, and intersections or spatial overlap by the contractors. The goal of the game is to optimize the debris collection operations. The game assists you in this goal via Deborah â€“ an optimised algorithm for the debris collection problem. The human player and machine Deborah collaborate with each other to optimise each objective and the over all debris collection operation.
