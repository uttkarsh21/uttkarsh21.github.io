Our goal in this program is to facilitate the coordinated
transformation of the workforce in industry and in the government
(both civilian and military sectors) and ensure that the training
and capability of skilled personnel in the government sector (both
uniformed and civilian) are able to adapt and keep pace with the
accelerated rate of change in advanced and additive
manufacturing practices.
