StudyCrafter is a free playful platform where users can create, play, and share research projects to advance our understanding of human behavior together.
It is intended for teaching research and conducting the next generation of social and behavioral science research – and to engage the public at large with scientific research across the world. It takes a playful approach to science: it inspires users to find creative ways to explore human behavior and enables them to create gamified projects to engage their participants.


#### Project Details

The StudyCrafter Team and collaborators are researching how people use and learn with StudyCrafter. We also evaluate how its use helps to advance our understanding of human behavior. Based on our research, we make changes to the platform and develop guidelines and best practices – for StudyCrafter and for the social and behavioral sciences at large. See our Research page for more information.
