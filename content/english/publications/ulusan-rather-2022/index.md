abstract: 'Optimizing operations on critical infrastructure networks is key to reducing
  the impact of disruptive events. In this paper, we explore the potential of having
  humans and algorithms work together to address this difficult task. For this purpose,
  we use a gamified experiment to build and assess this potential in the context of
  the debris collection problem (i.e., “gamesploring”). We developed a digital game
  where players can request the help of the computer while facing a multi-objective
  problem of assigning contractors to road segments for clearing debris in a disaster
  area. Through a within-subjects experimental study, we assessed how players optimized
  under various circumstances (e.g., initial solution vs. from scratch) compared to
  the computer on its own. The results are both surprising as well as insightful:
  they suggest that human-machine collaboration is indeed beneficial but also that
  more work is needed on how to appropriately guide this form of collaboration.'
