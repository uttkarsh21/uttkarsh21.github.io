abstract: Traditionally, game designers have driven the development process of psychotherapeutic
  games with psychotherapists playing a consultant role. In contrast, our study explores
  psychotherapists independently designing digitally gamified psychotherapy. Our workshop
  participants consisted of six psychotherapists who created gamified digital therapies
  with the design prompt of anxiety disorder. We analyze the resulting six prototypes
  from a game design and psychotherapy perspective. We present insights into strategies
  for digitally gamifying therapy and identify challenges and opportunities for the
  future of gamified psychotherapy, grounded in the experiences of psychotherapists
  designing such therapies. This study also reflects on the use of user-friendly development
  tools for independently curating gamified digital therapies, especially by non-technical
  users such as psychotherapists.
