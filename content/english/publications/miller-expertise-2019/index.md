abstract: "Many studies have already shown that games can be a useful tool to make
  boring or difficult tasks more engaging. However, with serious game design being
  a relatively nascent field, such experiences can still be hard to learn and not
  very motivating. In this paper, we explore the use of learning and motivation frameworks
  to improve player experience in the well-known citizen science game Foldit. Using
  Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and Self Determination Theory (SDT), we developed six
  interface and mechanical changes to the tutorial levels in Foldit designed to increase
  engagement and retention. We tested these features with new players of Foldit and
  collected both behavioral data, using game metrics, and prior experience data, using
  self-report measures. This study offers three major contributions: (1) we document
  the process of operationalizing CLT and SDT as new game features, a unique methodology
  not used in game design previously; (2) the user interface, specifically the level
  selection screen, significantly impacts how players progress through the game; and
  (3) a player's expertise, whether from prior domain knowledge or prior gaming experience,
  increases their engagement. We discuss both implications of these findings as well
  as how these implementations can generalize to other designs."
