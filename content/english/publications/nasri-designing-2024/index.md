abstract: Apprenticeship and training programs in advanced manufacturing frequently
  encounter safety and accessibility concerns due to using heavy machinery. Virtual
  Reality (VR) training addresses such constraints while maintaining the spatial and
  procedural learning requirements of such training. However, designing effective
  VR training is challenging because advanced manufacturing processes are complex
  and require experts to train novices for a long time. This paper presents a VR Training
  Apprenticeship (VRTA) tailored for cold spray, which we carefully designed to teach
  novices step-by-step this particular advanced manufacturing process. To assess its
  effectiveness, we conducted an exploratory study (n = 22). We evaluated user experience
  (UX) measures in the form of quantitative scales, usersâ€™ qualitative insights, and
  task performance with real-world machinery after the VR training. We discuss how
  the VRTA design contributed to the effectiveness and the challenges of considering
  VR training for advanced manufacturing.
