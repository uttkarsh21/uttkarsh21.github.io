abstract: Ethical theories and Generative AI (GenAI) models are dynamic concepts subject
  to continuous evolution. This paper investigates the visualization of ethics through
  a subset of GenAI models. We expand on the emerging field of Visual Ethics, using
  art as a form of critical inquiry and the metaphor of a kaleidoscope to invoke moral
  imagination. Through formative interviews with 10 ethics experts, we first establish
  a foundation of ethical theories. Our analysis reveals five families of ethical
  theories, which we then transform into images using the text-to-image (T2I) GenAI
  model. The resulting imagery, curated as Kaleidoscope Gallery and evaluated by the
  same experts, revealed eight themes that highlight how morality, society, and learned
  associations are central to ethical theories. We discuss implications for critically
  examining T2I models and present cautions and considerations. This work contributes
  to examining ethical theories as foundational knowledge that interrogates GenAI
  models as socio-technical systems.
