      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Debris, players are tasked with assigning contractors to collect debris around a borough in New York after it was hit with a natural disaster. The players need to do this while considering the three objectives of time spent, money earned, and intersections or spatial overlap by the contractors. The goal of the game is to optimize the debris collection operations. The game assists you in this goal via Deborah â€“ an optimised algorithm for the debris collection problem. The human player and machine Deborah collaborate with each other to optimise each objective and the over all debris collection operation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GeoExplorer is an educational game has been developed for undergraduate classroom settings for the instruction of Geotechnical Engineering (i.e., a subdiscipline of Civil Engineering). The vision behind this game is to provide experience for undergraduate civil engineering students with various field testing techniques for which students traditionally get little to no hands-on exposure. The current version of the game focuses on Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) and gives students an opportunity to experience and learn the important geotechnical engineering task of identifying soil types across different locations via CPT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our goal in this program is to facilitate the coordinated&#xA;transformation of the workforce in industry and in the government&#xA;(both civilian and military sectors) and ensure that the training&#xA;and capability of skilled personnel in the government sector (both&#xA;uniformed and civilian) are able to adapt and keep pace with the&#xA;accelerated rate of change in advanced and additive&#xA;manufacturing practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
